# Serverless Recipe Generator Web Application
I developed a serverless web application that leverages AWS Amplify and Amazon Bedrock to generate creative recipes from user-submitted ingredients. Using AWS Amplify, I built and hosted a frontend with an HTML-based interface for ingredient input, integrated with continuous deployment via GitHub. The backend, powered by AWS Lambda and AWS AppSync’s GraphQL API, processes requests and connects to Amazon Bedrock’s Claude 3 Sonnet model for AI-driven recipe generation. I configured Amplify Auth with AWS Cognito for secure user access and enabled Bedrock foundation model integration. This beginner-friendly project, completed in 35 minutes using Node.js and npm, showcases my skills in serverless architecture, cloud services, and generative AI within AWS’s Free Tier.
